# Regan Day's Portfolio
This is the portfolio project I created for my BAIS:3300 Digital Product Management class at the University of Iowa. As the final project of the semester, this incorporated everything I learned in this class into one website. I completed this class in the Spring 2024 semester.

## What Did I Learn?
- I downloaded an HTML template from Start Bootstrap to start customizing.
- After previously sketching the sitemap, wireframe, and storyboard, I changed the template to reflect my portfolio desires.
- I ensured the HTML5 and CSS3 were validated and correct.
- I also used the WAVE Evaluation tool to make sure my website was accessible to all, valudating WCAG2.1, level AA standards for accessibility.
- I learned how to use Microsoft Azure cloud services to get my site up and running.
- I connected my custom domain purchased and configured at NameCheap to Azure.


## Installation Instructions
